        This function performs the same task as the `Flexpart Prepare <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/flexpart+prepare>`_ icon in Metviewâ€™s user interface. It accepts its parameters as keyword arguments, described below.


.. py:function:: flexpart_prepare(**kwargs)
  
    Description comes here!


    :param prepare_mode: Specifies the data preparation mode. The possible values are: "forecast" and period.

         In "forecast" mode the selected ``step``s of a given "forecast" can be used for data generation. If the mode is set to period a period with a start and end ``date`` and constant ``time``-``step`` can be defined. In this case FLEXTRA Prepare_ tries to retrieve analysis fields from MARS whenever it is possible (for ``date``s in the past) and uses "forecast" fields otherwise (for ``date``s in the future).
    :type prepare_mode: str, default: "forecast"


    :param input_source: Specifies the source of the input GRIB data. The possible values are: "mars" and file.The default value is "mars".

         If the ``input_source`` is "mars" the input GRIB data is retrieved from the "mars" archive. When ``prepare_mode`` is forecast the ``input_source`` can also be set to file. In this case the GRIB file specified in ``input_file`` will be used as input data.
    :type input_source: str, default: "mars"


    :param input_file: Specifies the full path to the file containing the input GRIB data. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is forecast and  ``input_source`` is file. The ``input_file`` must contain the following fields:  

         Filed type| Parameters| Forecast ``step``s (defined in ``step``) ---|---|--- surface fields|

         ["sd","msl","tcc","10u","10v","2t","2d","sp", "z","lsm","lcc","mcc","hcc","skt", "stl1","swvl1"]

         | all surface fluxes| ["lsp","cp","sshf","ewss","nsss","ssr"] | all + additional ``step``s (see the note below) model level fields| ["u","v","t","q","etadot"]| all surface analysis| ["sdor","cvl","cvh","sr"] | required for the valid ``date`` of ``step`` 0  The surface fluxes are accumulated fields and for the de-accumulation process they also require the ``step`` preceding the first ``step``. We have a special case when the first ``step`` is 0 because in this case we need two additional ``step``s but from the previous model run! E.g. for a 0 UTC model run when we use 3 hourly ``step``s we need the fluxes from ``step``=6 and ``step``=3 of the 18 UTC run on the previous day.
    :type input_file: str


    :param date: Specifies the run ``date`` of the forecast. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is forecast.
    :type date: number, default: -1


    :param time: Specifies the run ``time`` of the forecast in hours. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is forecast.
    :type time: number, default: 0


    :param step: Specifies the forecast ``step``s in hours. Here a list of values is given. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is forecast.
    :type step: str or list[str], default: "0"


    :param period_start_date: Specifies the start ``date`` of the period. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is period.
    :type period_start_date: number, default: -1


    :param period_start_time: Specifies the start ``time`` of the period. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is period.
    :type period_start_time: number, default: 0


    :param period_end_date: Specifies the end ``date`` of the period. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is period.
    :type period_end_date: number, default: -1


    :param period_end_time: Specifies the end ``time`` of the period. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is period.
    :type period_end_time: number, default: 0


    :param period_step: Specifies the ``time`` ``step`` of the period in hours. The allowed values are as follows: "3" or 6. Available when ``prepare_mode`` is period. The default value is "3".
    :type period_step: str, default: "3"


    :param grid_interpolation: Specifies if the input GRIB fields need to be interpolated onto a target ``grid`` specified by ``area`` and ``grid``. The possible values are "on" / "off". Available when ``input_source`` is file. The default value is: "on".
    :type grid_interpolation: {"on", "off"}, default: "on"


    :param area: Specifies the ``area`` of the output ``grid`` in south/west/north/east format. The default value is -90/-179/90/180.

         Please note that to make global domains work with FLEXPART the western border must be set to one ``grid``cell east of 180. E.g. if the east-west ``grid`` resolution is 1 degree ``area`` should be set to -90/-179/90/180 etc.
    :type area: float or list[float], default: -90


    :param grid: Specifies the resolution of the output ``grid`` in dx/dy format, where dx is the ``grid`` increment in east-west direction, while dy is the ``grid`` increment in north-south direction (both in units of degrees). The default value is: 1/1.
    :type grid: float or list[float], default: 1


    :param top_level: Only data on and below this model level will be used to generate the FLEXPART input fields. This level can be specified either as a model level or as a pressure value. In the latter case FLEXPART Prepare will use the data retrieved for the first ``date`` to determine the topmost model level. The default value of this parameter is 1 , which means that all the model levels will be used if ``top_level`` Units is set to model_levels.
    :type top_level: number, default: 1


    :param top_level_units: Specifies the units of the value of ``top_level``. The allowed values are model_levels or hPa. The default value is model_levels.
    :type top_level_units: str, default: "ml"


    :param reuse_input: 
    :type reuse_input: str, default: "on"


    :param output_path: Specifies the output directory (can be a relative or absolute path) where the GRIB files and the AVAILABLE file will be generated. If this directory does not exist Metview will create it. The output GRIB files have the following naming convention: EN yymmddhh._
    :type output_path: str


    :rtype: None
