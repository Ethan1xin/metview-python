		Generates a fixed set of meteorological parameters forecasts as a function of forecast time for a given location or set of locations (arbitrary or meteorological station). This `web page <http://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/charts/medium/ens-meteograms>`_ describes the meteograms generated by :func:`meteogram`.
		
		.. warning:: :func:`meteogram` is only available to internal installations at ECMWF.


		.. note:: This function performs the same task as the `Meteogram <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/meteogram>`_ icon in Metviewâ€™s user interface. It accepts its parameters as keyword arguments, described below.


.. py:function:: meteogram(**kwargs)
  
    Generates meteograms.


    :param type: Specifies the type of meteogram to be generated. The "epsgrams" are derived from the ENS, whereas the "metgrams" are derived from the deterministic forecast model. The available types are:
		
		* "10_days_epsgram"
		* "15_days_epsgram"
		* "15_days_epsgram_with_climate"
		* "10_days_wave_epsgram"
		* "10_days_plumes"
    :type type: {"10_days_epsgram", "15_days_epsgram", "15_days_epsgram_with_climate", "10_days_wave_epsgram", "10_days_plumes"}, default: "15_days_epsgram"

    :param station: Specifies the location as a :func:`stations` object at which to derive the meteogram.
    :type station: :func:`stations`

    :param data_selection_type: Determines how the meteogram data source is selected: 
		
		* "latest": will retrieve the latest meteogram available
		* "date": will allow the further selection of a specific ``date`` and ``time``
		* "local": allows the specification of a path to a local SPOT ``database`` (details of the database format are not provided here).
    :type data_selection_type: {"latest", "date", "local"}, default: "latest"

    :param date: Specifies the day on which the forecast is based (first day on the plot). The default value is -1 (yesterday), but you can use other formats, such as YYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD. Available when ``data_selection_type`` is set to "date".
    :type date: number, default: -1

    :param forecast_run_time: Specify the forecast time (hours of the day) from either 00h or 12h. Only available if ``data_selection_type`` is set to "date".
    :type forecast_run_time: {"00", "12"}, default: "12"

    :param experiment: Specifies the MARS experiment number from which the meteograms are to be plotted. You will only need to modify this parameter if you want to display data from a source other than the ECMWF model. Note that this parameter is a string, so for example '0001' is different from '1'.
    :type experiment: str, default: "0001"

    :param format: Specifies the output format.
    :type format: {"pdf", "png", "ps"}, default: "pdf"

    :param database: If not "latest", then this parameter is taken to be the entire path to the database directory. Available when ``data_selection_type`` is "local".
    :type database: str, default: "latest"

    :rtype: :class:`Request`
