..     ``options`` specifies the various settings for the parcel computations. The members of this dict are as follows (temperature values are in Â°C and pressure values are in hPa):

..     * **mode**: the start condition mode. The possible values are 'surface', 'custom', 'mean_layer' and 'most_unstable' (see  below for details)
..     * **start_t**: the start temperature (see  below for details)
..     * **start_td**: the start dewpoint (see  below for details)
..     * **start_p**: the start pressure (see  below for details)
..     * **top_p**: the top pressure of the start layer (see below for details)
..     * **bottom_p**: the bottom pressure of the start layer (see below for details)
..     * **stop_at_el**: if it is defined and set to 1 the parcel computations will stop at the Equilibrium Level.

..     There are four different modes available for the parcel start conditions:

..     * **Surface**: the parcel ascends from the surface, i.e. the lowest point of the profile. The format is as follows:

..         .. code-block:: python
            
..             {mode: "surface"}

..     * **Custom**: the parcel ascends from a given temperature, dewpoint and pressure. The format is as follows:
    
..         .. code-block:: python
            
..             {mode: 'custom', 
..              start_t: start_temperature,

..              start_p: start_pressure}

..     * **Mean layer**: the parcel ascends from the mean temperature, dew point and pressure of a given pressure layer. The format is as follows:
    
..         .. code-block:: python
            
..             {mode: 'mean_layer',
..              top_p: layer_top,
..              bottom_p: layer_bottom}

..         When bottom_p is omitted the layer starts at the surface.
    
..     * **Most unstable**: the parcel ascends from the most unstable condition. To determine this, a parcel is started from all the points along the profile in the specified pressure layer. The start level of the parcel that results in the highest CAPE value will define the most unstable start condition. The format is as follows:
        
..         .. code-block:: python

..             {mode: 'most_unstable', 
..              top_p: layer_top, 
..              bottom_p: layer_bottom}

..         When bottom_p is omitted the pressure layer starts at the surface.

..     :func:`thermo_parcel_path` returns a dict to describe all the parameters related to the ascend of the parcel. The members of this definition are as follows (temperature values are in Â°C and pressure values are in hPa) :

..     * el: Equilibrium Level. It is a definition with two members: t and p. If no EL exists it is set to None.

..     * top: Cloud Top Level. It is a definition with two members: t and p. If no TOP exists it is set to None.

..     * start: start conditions of the parcel with four members: mode, t, td and p.

..     * for other level types ``omega`` must be a :class:`Fieldset` defining the pressure on the same levels as ``omega``.

..     The computation is based on the following hydrostatic formula:

..     .. math:: 

..         w = - \frac{\omega T R_{d}}{p g}

..     where

..     * Rd is the specific gas constant for dry air (287.058 J/(kg K)).
